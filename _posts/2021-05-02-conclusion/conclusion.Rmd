# Conclusion

A pig who plays video games, a cuttlefish with self-control, birds who play with others, dolphins who use tools,...All this articles demonstrate a little part of how smart animals can be !  
For a long time Humans have been thinking that they are the only intelligent form of life on earth. They thought that their abilities to design tool and use it, their feelings, their awareness, their notion of time separate their mind from an animal but animals are also able to have self-control, feelings, make tools and use it to ! 
So it is unquestionable : Animals can be very smart!
