## Analysis table about the study

* Researchers? : 
  + A team from the "Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology Unit" in the German Primate Center (DPZ = Deutsches Primatenzentrum).
  + Claudia Fichtel, one of the two first authors of the study
* Published in ? when? : published in "ScienceDaily" on September 25, 2020
* Procedure/What was examined ? : In first, they used a comprehensive standardized test series of cognitive experiments : "Primate Cognition Test Battery" (PCTB). Small children and great apes (baboons, macaques) have been tested for their cognitive abilities in the physical and social domain.
then they tested three lemur species with the PCTB. 
* conclusion/ discovery : Initial studies have shown that children possess a better social intelligence than non-human primates. In the physical domain, the species hardly differed even though they show great variation in their relative brain sizes. 
the test on the three lemur species show that despite their smaller brains lemurs' average cognitive performance in the tests of the PCTB was not fundamentally different from the performances of the other primate species. the cognitives abillities of apes can not be generalized.
